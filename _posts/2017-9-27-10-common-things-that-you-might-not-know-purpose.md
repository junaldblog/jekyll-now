title: 10 Common Things that You Might Not Know the Purpose
category: Info

There are things around us so familiar that become boring sometimes – and some, which we have no or wrong idea why they should be there.
In this post, I have ten things that you might not know what they are for, though you see them most of the time.

## 1. The Loop at the back of your shirt –

You might be wondering why there is a loop at the back of your shirt. For sure, tailors bothered to put it for a purpose. 
There are three popular reasons why it is there and it is unknown, which is right.

The first, which is the obvious reason, is for you to hang your shirt on a hook. However, it does not make any sense. 
If you hang your shirt by that loop, it can wrinkle quickly.

The second could be the answer. It is there to fasten your tie easier, which I don’t really understand how.

The last purpose is more romantic. Few years ago, American university students were said to have removed the 
loop of their shirts when they start dating a girl exclusively. To show that she was taken, the girl will wear 
a scarf with the university’s emblem. Is it very romantic?

## 2. The cylinder on your laptop’s power cable –

Most people see the cylinder on their laptop’s power cable every day and have no idea what its purpose. Some believe it is for decoration. 
It is called the ferrite bead. It suppresses high frequency noise in the electrical circuit. The design is quite simple. It is made from 
ferrite and it is covered to protect it.

## 3. The tiny hole in the window of the plane –

Airplane windows are made up of two pieces of a special kind of plastic-glass. Without the tiny hole in the window, 
the inner piece of glass will shatter due to the difference in pressure between the plane’s cabin and the outside.
